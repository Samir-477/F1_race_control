**Purpose:** Automatically updates a driver's total points when race results are added or modified.

**Trigger Type:** AFTER INSERT/UPDATE on `RaceResult` table

**SQL:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER after_race_result_insert
AFTER INSERT ON RaceResult
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE Driver
    SET points = points + NEW.points
    WHERE id = NEW.driverId;
END
```

**GUI Location:** Admin Dashboard → Database Features → Trigger Management

**How to Test:**
1. Navigate to Race Management
2. Complete a race and add results
3. Check Trigger Management page to see execution logs
4. Verify driver points are automatically updated

### Trigger 2: Auto-log Penalty Assignments
**Name:** `after_penalty_assignment_insert`

**Purpose:** Automatically creates an audit log entry when a penalty is assigned to an incident.

**Trigger Type:** AFTER INSERT on `PenaltyAssignment` table

**SQL:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER after_penalty_assignment_insert
AFTER INSERT ON PenaltyAssignment
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO RaceLog (raceId, lap, description, severity, timestamp)
    SELECT 
        ri.raceId,
        ri.lap,
        CONCAT('Penalty assigned by steward to driver for incident on lap ', ri.lap),
        'WARNING',
        NOW()
    FROM RaceIncident ri
    WHERE ri.id = NEW.incidentId;
END
```

**GUI Location:** Admin Dashboard → Database Features → Trigger Management

**How to Test:**
1. Create an incident during race monitoring
