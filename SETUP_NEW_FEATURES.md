# Setup Guide for New Database Features

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to enable all the new database features (triggers, procedures, functions):

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

```bash
cd server
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**OR** manually run the SQL file:

```bash
# For MySQL
mysql -u root -p f1_race_control < prisma/migrations/20251030131400_add_triggers_procedures_functions/migration.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration

Check if triggers, procedures, and functions were created:

```sql
-- Check triggers
SHOW TRIGGERS;

-- Check procedures
SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db = 'f1_race_control';

-- Check functions
SHOW FUNCTION STATUS WHERE Db = 'f1_race_control';
```

You should see:
- **Triggers:** `after_race_result_insert`, `after_race_result_update`, `after_penalty_assignment_insert`
- **Procedures:** `CalculateChampionshipStandings`, `GenerateRaceReport`
- **Functions:** `CalculateRaceTimeWithPenalties`, `GetDriverPerformanceRating`

### Step 3: Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
# Server
cd server
npm install

# Client
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Step 4: Start the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start server
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Start client
cd client
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Access New Features

1. **Login as ADMIN**
   - Go to http://localhost:5173
   - Click "Login"
   - Use admin credentials

2. **Navigate to Admin Dashboard**
   - You'll see new sections in the sidebar:
     - **Analytics & Reports**
       - Championship Standings
       - Penalty Statistics
       - Drivers with Incidents
     - **Database Features**
       - Trigger Management

3. **Test Each Feature:**

   **Championship Standings (Stored Procedure):**
   - Click "Championship Standings"
   - Select a season
   - Toggle between Driver/Team
   - Click "Refresh" to execute procedure

   **Trigger Management:**
   - Click "Trigger Management"
   - View active triggers
   - See execution history (logs created by triggers)

   **Penalty Statistics (Aggregate Queries):**
   - Click "Penalty Statistics"
   - Toggle between Driver/Team/Type views
   - Filter by season
   - View aggregated data

   **Drivers with Incidents (Nested Query):**
   - Click "Drivers with Incidents"
   - Filter by season
   - See drivers with incidents in completed races

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reset and reapply
cd server
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Issue: Triggers not executing

**Check:**
1. Verify triggers exist: `SHOW TRIGGERS;`
2. Check MySQL user has TRIGGER privilege
3. Look at server logs for errors

### Issue: Procedures return empty results

**Check:**
1. Ensure you have completed races with results
2. Run seed script to populate data:
```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

### Issue: "lucide-react" module not found

**Solution:**
```bash
cd client
npm install lucide-react
```

## 📊 Testing the Features

### Test Triggers:

1. **Test Auto-update Driver Points:**
   ```
   - Go to Race Management
   - Create/Complete a race
   - Add race results
   - Check driver points are automatically updated
   - View Trigger Management → Execution History
   ```

2. **Test Auto-log Penalty Assignments:**
   ```
   - Go to Race Monitoring
   - Create an incident
   - Assign a penalty
   - Check Trigger Management → Execution History
   - See automatic log entry
   ```

### Test Procedures:

1. **Championship Standings:**
   ```
   - Navigate to Championship Standings
   - Select a season with completed races
   - Click "Refresh"
   - Verify standings are calculated correctly
   ```

2. **Race Report:**
   ```
   - Go to Race Management
   - Find a completed race
   - Click "View Report" (if button exists)
   - OR use API: GET /api/analytics/race-report/:raceId
   ```

### Test Functions:

Functions are used internally, but you can test via API:

```bash
# Test Calculate Race Time with Penalties
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3002/api/analytics/race-time-with-penalties/1/1

# Test Driver Performance Rating
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3002/api/analytics/driver-performance/1/1
```

### Test Queries:

1. **Nested Query (Drivers with Incidents):**
   ```
   - Navigate to "Drivers with Incidents"
   - Filter by season
   - Verify only drivers with incidents in completed races appear
   ```

2. **Aggregate Queries (Penalty Statistics):**
   ```
   - Navigate to "Penalty Statistics"
   - Toggle between views (Driver/Team/Type)
   - Verify counts and aggregations are correct
   ```
