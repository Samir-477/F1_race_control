### **Frontend**
1. `client/components/RaceStandingsTable.tsx` - Standings table component
2. `client/components/IncidentReviewPanel.tsx` - Incident list panel
3. `client/components/AddIncidentModal.tsx` - Add incident form modal
4. `client/components/RaceMonitoringView.tsx` - Main race monitoring view

### **Modified**

## üîå API Endpoints Added

### Race Log Generation
```
POST /api/races/:raceId/generate-race-logs
```
Generates realistic F1 race logs using the simulation algorithm.

### Get Race Standings
```
GET /api/races/:raceId/standings
```
Returns current race standings with penalties applied.

### Create Incident
```
POST /api/races/:raceId/create-incident
Body: { driverId, lap, description, penaltyType, penaltyValue, useAI }
```
Creates a new incident. If `useAI: true`, uses Gemini to generate description.

### Get Race Incidents
```
GET /api/races/:raceId/race-incidents
```
Returns all incidents for a race.

### Finalize Race
```
POST /api/races/:raceId/finalize
```
Marks race as COMPLETED and publishes results.

## üéÆ How to Use

### **For Stewards:**

1. **Navigate to Race Monitoring**
   - Click "Race Monitoring" in the sidebar
   - See list of all races

2. **Generate Race Logs**
   - Click "Generate Race Logs" button for a race
   - Wait 2-3 seconds for simulation
   - Race logs are generated instantly

3. **View Race Standings**
   - Click "View Race Log" button
   - Opens full-screen race monitoring view
   - See live standings table

4. **Add Incidents**
   - Click "+ Add Incident" button
   - Select driver and lap
   - Toggle "Use AI" for automatic description
   - Select penalty type and value
   - Submit

5. **Finalize Race**
   - Review all incidents and penalties
   - Click "Finalize & Publish Results"
   - Race marked as COMPLETED

## ü§ñ AI Integration

### **Gemini API Usage**
- **Purpose**: Generate realistic incident descriptions
- **Trigger**: When "Use AI" checkbox is enabled in Add Incident modal
- **Fallback**: If API fails, uses template-based descriptions
- **API Key**: Loaded from `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`

### **Example AI-Generated Description:**
```
"Car #44 Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) made contact with Car #33 
Max Verstappen at Turn 4, causing both drivers to go off track. 
The incident occurred during an overtaking maneuver on the inside line."
```
